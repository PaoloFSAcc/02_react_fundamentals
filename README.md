# 02_react_fundamentals
Pluralsight course by Liam McLennan for Full Stack University at Accenture

1. The clicker app differs from the video since create-react-app now delivers a function component, instead of a class component
2. Create authorquiz app with create-react-app
3. Add bootstrap: get it from: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
4. Save that to src: You have to edit the css to make it pretty, otherwise bad formatting is copied from the browser.
5. Be careful when passing props with spread operator
6. For testing, the instructions use enzyme adapter with react 16, this has not been yet officially released so I used: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
7. Even though I have the same code as the one found in another github repository, the last test does not run. (https://github.com/andasimion/AuthorQuiz-react-redux/blob/master/src/AuthorQuiz.test.js)
8. A bit distracted on the Form Library part (JSONSchemaForm), check Chapter 6, video Form Libraries, minute 3:13
